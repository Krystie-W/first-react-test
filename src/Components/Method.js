                <li>Peel and remove the seeds from the butternut squash and cut into small 1/2 inch sized cubes. Place the cubes in a bowl with 1 tbsp oil, smoked paprika and 1 tsp cumin and toss so that each cube is well seasoned. Place the butternut squash on a baking sheet and bake in the oven for 20 minutes.</li>
                <li>While the butternut squash cooks, in a cast iron skillet or oven proof frying pan saute the chorizo in 1 tbsp oil with a pinch of salt, the diced onion, peppers and 1 tbsp of the diced jalapeno. Once the onion becomes translucent (4-5 minutes) add in the spinach, 1/2 tsp lime juice and 1 tsp cumin. Cook for another minute.</li>
                <li>Add the butternut squash to pan with the veggies and stir to ensure everything is evenly mixed. Create 3-4 wells in the mixture and crack an egg into each.</li>
                <li>Place the pan in the oven and cook for 8-10 minutes depending on how runny you prefer your eggs.</li>
                <li>Remove from the oven and serve with sliced avocado and wedges of lime.</li>
